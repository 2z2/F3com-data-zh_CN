# Support and Licensing

Technical support is available at the official discussion forum: [`https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/f3-framework`](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/f3-framework). If you need live support, you can talk to the development team and other members of the F3 community via IRC. We're on the FreeNode `#fatfree` channel (`chat.freenode.net`). Visit [`http://webchat.freenode.net/`](http://webchat.freenode.net/) to join the conversation. You can also download the [Firefox Chatzilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatzilla/) add-on or [Pidgin](http://www.pidgin.im/) if you don't have an IRC client so you can participate in the live chat.

## Nightly Builds
