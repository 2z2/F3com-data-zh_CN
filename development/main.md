# Development

## About

The Fat-Free Framework is an open source PHP framework, written by Bong Cosca in 2009.
The philosophy behind the framework and its approach to software architecture is towards minimalism in structural components, avoiding application complexity and striking a balance between code elegance, application performance and programmer productivity.
Out comes a full-featured toolkit for web artisans, that will make your daily work a lot easier, no matter if you're a beginner or expert.

**Now version 3.0 is finally here!**

The latest official release marks a major milestone in the development of the Fat-Free Framework. Packed with exciting new features and outstanding documentation that took several months to develop and refine, version 3.0 is finally available for download. The code base has been rewritten from the ground up to provide enterprise-class architecture and performance but with the same user-friendly features and lightweight footprint.
It is highly recommended that experienced users develop new applications with this version to take advantage of the latest features and significant improvements.
