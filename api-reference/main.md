# API Reference

Welcome to the API documentation. It's intended as a feature reference to give you more detailed information about working with F3.

The framework API documentation is also contained in `lib/api.chm` of the distribution package. F3 uses [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) to generate output in compiled HTML format.

You need a CHM reader to view its tree-structured contents. For Mac users, there's [Chmox](http://chmox.sourceforge.net/) and [iChm](http://code.google.com/p/ichm/). Linux users have more choices: [xCHM](http://xchm.sourceforge.net/), [GnoCHM](http://gnochm.sourceforge.net/), [ChmSee](http://code.google.com/p/chmsee/), and [Kchmviewer](http://www.ulduzsoft.com/linux/kchmviewer/). Windows supports `.chm` files right out of the box.
